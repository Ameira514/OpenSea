## **Evolution & Growth of OpenSea**

The company came about after both Atallah & Finzer had worked previously at start ups and listened to what users had wanted and what they were looking for. Atallah & Finzer both point out they were fortunate enough to come into the marketplace at the 'right time'.

OpenSea was initially generating an income of $28,000 a month 4 years ago. It now generates a gross revenue of $873 million as of the close of 2021.  The servicing fees is 2.5% of the value of the sale whenever a digital asset is sold. 

As of January 2022, the latest funding was generated through a series c round which brought 48 investors to the table.  OpenSea has also acquired two additional organizations over the last four years. This has now brought the value of the company to $13.3 billion dollars.


## **Business Activities:**

Recently, there was issues arising from a loophole where NFTs were purchased for a fraction of their true cost then resold for thousands.  OpenSea then found themselves reimbursing those who had been affected by these sales.  

The loophole, which has now been fixed and is being monitored, gave sellers the ability to relist an NFT without cancelling the previous listing.  A spokesperson explained that this had not been an exploit or bug, but was instead an issue due to the nature of the blockchain.

With over half a million users who are now registered with OpenSea, it is an open playground to discover, trade, buy, & sell NFTs for anyone who is interested.   The site alone attracts over 120 million visitors per month and is the largest NFT marketplace as of today holding a marketshare of over 90%.

OpenSea has a leg up in its industry by offering the largest variety of NFTs.  They also offer competitve commissions and some of the industries leading security in transactions. The cons of using OpenSea is that it only accepts payments in cryptocurrency and as a consumer you will need a crypto wallet to buy and sell on the platform.

One of the technologies OpenSea is currently using is they allow users to own & purchase their NFT's by using Ethereum's blockchain, Coinbase Wallet, Fortmatic, and Dapper.


## **Landscape:**

OpenSea falls within the domain of cryptocurrency and blockchain.

Cryptocurrency has grown exponentially and continues to grow within the financial and technology realm.  While crypto was initially viewed with skepticism it is now a market that exceeds $1.6 trillion and estimates 300 million users worldwide. Many of these institutions are now actively allocating capital into crypto.

NFTs or non-fungible tokens are now creating a stir and have become relatively mainstream as of 2021.  

Some of the major competitors with OpenSea are Smart Valor, Syscoin, Dapp.com, and bitFlyer.
